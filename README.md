CodeSpells
==========

A picking through different spells made by the CodeSpells community. A personal project for breaking down and understanding how CodeSpells works by example. It also makes for a collection of different spells, looking at how they are made in both Blockly and JavaScript/UnityScript.

This project is currently halted, due to other means of collecting together spells existing and changes in the CodeSpells build that have broken many of the existing spells.
